Observations ::

Loss Curve Analysis - Check how the loss decreases over epochs. A model with a higher number of units should ideally learn the sequence better, leading to a lower loss.

Prediction Accuracy - Compare the predicted values with the actual values. A model with more hidden units might better capture the sequence patterns and thus show predictions closer to the actual values.

Overfitting - Watch out for overfitting if the loss decreases significantly on the training data but not on new data. You might need to use regularization techniques or reduce the model complexity.

Example Observations:

Model with Fewer Units: It might not capture the sequence patterns effectively, resulting in higher loss and less accurate predictions.
Model with More Units: Typically, the loss decreases more rapidly and predictions are closer to actual values, but be cautious of overfitting if the number of units is too high.
